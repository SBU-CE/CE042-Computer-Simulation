## Introduction

Welcome to the computer simulation course repository on GitHub!

This repository serves as a central hub for all the course materials, including lecture notes, assignments, code samples, and other resources that will help you learn and practice the concepts of computer simulation.

The aim of this course is to introduce you to the fundamentals of computer simulation and provide you with practical experience in building and running simulations. The materials in this repository are designed to help you achieve these goals, with a focus on hands-on learning and real-world applications.
The repository is organized into different folders, each containing resources related to a particular topic or aspect of computer simulation. You will find lecture notes, slides, and code samples in the "lectures" folder, while assignments and projects will be located in the "assignments" folder. There is also a "resources" folder that contains additional materials such as books, papers, and links to useful online resources.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for you throughout the course and beyond. Let's get started on the exciting journey of learning and applying computer simulation!
